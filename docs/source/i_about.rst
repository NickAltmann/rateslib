Future Development
*******************

As a new library the future development of ``rateslib`` is open to many avenues.
Some possibilities include:

- JSON: transferring objects between server-client.
- Datafeeds: automatic or realtime pricing updates of curves.
- Optimization: using C code to improve efficiency.
- Volatility: adding swaptions and volatility cubes.
- Excel: using the JSON interface to allow fluid connectivity with Excel.
- Inflation: adding inflation linked bonds and inflation swaps
